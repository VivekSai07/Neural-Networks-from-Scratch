# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

Welcome to the Neural Networks from scratch GitHub repository!

This repository contains necessary code for implementation of Neural Networks and understand neural networks from scratch.

- [Neural Networks with Sigmoid Activation function](https://github.com/VivekSai07/Neural-Networks-from-Scratch/blob/main/Neural%20Networks%20with%20sigmoid%20activation%20function/Lab-1%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)
- [Neural Networks with Sigmoid Activation function using ADAM Optimizer](https://github.com/VivekSai07/Neural-Networks-from-Scratch/blob/main/Neural%20Networks%20using%20ADAM%20optimizer/Lab-2%20NN%20using%20Adam%20Optimizer.ipynb)

I hope that this repository will be helpful in understanding and implementing neural networks from scratch. Happy coding!
